# Chocolate Sales Data Analysis

Welcome to the *chocolate-flavored* analysis no one asked for but now you’re here, so might as well enjoy it.

This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook where I slice and dice some totally serious chocolate sales data. Yes, this is how I choose to spend my time.

## What's going on here?

I loaded a dataset full of chocolate stuff – types, prices, quantities, and mysterious margins. Then I tried to answer deep philosophical questions like:

- Which chocolate seller makes the most money?
- Are dark chocolates really better (of course yes)?
- Can you visualize sugar rush?

**Dataset source:**

## Tools used (because I had to)

- `pandas` – for wrestling the data into submission
- `numpy` – to feel smarter
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – for arts and crafts

## Steps (allegedly structured)

1. **Cleaning up the mess**  
   Checked for NaNs because that’s what the cool kids do (there weren't). Changing dtype for easier analysis because I'm lazy.

2. **Pretend analysis**  
   Grouped things according to the chocolate seller and looking for what made him get the best result, I have a few clues (I stopped there). 
   Finally, I wanted to see if there was seasonality in the chocolates sold (there is not)

3. **Fancy visuals**  
   Made some plots. Some of them even look good some not.

4. **Conclusions (very serious)**  
   - Some chocolates seller ar better than others. Groundbreaking.
   - seasonality was not experienced
   - There's definitely potential for… doing this better.

## Final thoughts

Will this change the world of chocolate? Probably not.  
Is it a decent excuse to mess around with data and make some plots? You bet.  
If you read this far, congratulations. You’re in a very exclusive club.
